The school was quiet after clubs ended. The sky was dark purple, and the lanterns from the festival still moved in the wind. Haruto walked to the old cherry tree. He saw Yuna standing there, calm and alone, like she always was.
“You came,” Yuna said.
“You asked,” Haruto replied.
They walked through the hallway together. It smelled like chalk and rain. Yuna touched the trophy case glass and looked at the fingerprints instead of the medals. Haruto said everyone wanted to win. Yuna said some people just wanted to stop losing. Her words were gentle but heavy.
They reached the door to the rooftop. It was supposed to be locked, but the frame was weak. Yuna pushed the side of the door, and it opened with a soft sound. They stepped outside. The wind was cool. The city lights looked like a low sky in the distance. From up there, the school felt peaceful.
“I used to be scared of heights,” Yuna said. “Now I’m used to looking down.”
“Don’t,” Haruto said.
“Not tonight,” she promised.
They stood close but didn’t touch. Haruto took out a small notebook with a single line of a poem. Yuna asked if she could read it. He said it wasn’t ready. She took a folded note from her blazer and placed it in his hand.
“Don’t read it yet,” she said. “It’s a warning.”
They walked along the edge of the roof and talked. Haruto told her his mother kept cracked teacups and called them survivors. Yuna said her father spoke softly outside and loudly at home. He asked her favorite season. She said early spring, when the petals fall right after they bloom. “Some things are beautiful because they don’t stay,” she said.
“That sounds like giving up,” he answered.
“It sounds honest,” she said.
“Stay late tomorrow,” Haruto told her. “I’ll bring the poem.”
“Tomorrow,” she said, but her smile looked weak.
Suddenly, they heard footsteps in the stairwell. The handle rattled. An older man’s voice called, “Who’s up there? The rooftop is off-limits.” Yuna didn’t look at the door. She looked toward a dark corner where a security camera used to be. Only the base was still there—the camera was gone.
“Who knows you come up here?” Haruto asked.
“No one,” Yuna said too quickly. Then, softer: “Only the ones who need to.”
The footsteps went away. The roof became quiet again.
“See?” Haruto said. “There’s still tomorrow.”
“You make things feel simple,” Yuna said.
“Sometimes they are.”
“Not for me,” she whispered.
She placed both hands on the railing. Haruto reached out, close to her but not touching.
“Yuna,” he said.
“Haruto,” she replied. It sounded like goodbye.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-content">
The wind grew stronger. A door slammed somewhere below. Yuna’s fingers tightened on the railing. She looked toward the dark corner again, then back at him. Her eyes were shiny, like she was holding back tears.
“If I leave,” she said, “promise you’ll keep something of me.”
“Don’t talk like that.”
“Promise.”
“I promise.”
For a moment, it was calm, like the night was holding its breath. Then everything happened too fast. Yuna moved forward in a way that didn’t look like a simple slip. Haruto grabbed for her. His fingers touched her sleeve—then there was only air. The sound of her fall felt like the sky tearing open.
He didn’t remember if he screamed. He only felt the cold railing under his hands. He looked down. The lanterns in the courtyard shook in the wind. A still shape lay near the cherry tree where they first met.
By morning, the school said it was suicide. Teachers spoke softly. Students cried online. Yellow tape blocked the rooftop. Fresh scratches marked the railing. Haruto said the expected words so people would leave him alone. When he got home, he remembered the note in his pocket.
He opened it carefully. Yuna’s handwriting was neat and clear.
If anything happens to me, it wasn’t an accident. Don’t trust the ones who arrive first.
Haruto sat down. He thought about the missing camera. He remembered the voice at the door. He remembered how Yuna said “tomorrow” like it was already broken.
He slid the note under his unfinished poem. The poem now had a purpose. So did he.
It wasn’t a fall. Someone pushed her.
